  </a>
  <p>
  A Custom ROM is basically a different operating system for your smartphone / tablet. Unlike the pre-installed firmware that is provided by the manufacturer, such as Samsung Touchwiz or HTC Sense, custom ROMs provide an almost pure Android experience much like that you'd find on Google's Nexus devices.

  Any hardcore Android fan will tell you that the real reason to have an Android phone is to root it &ndash; to take control, to get the full potential out of your device. Now, while we're not quite as fervently evangelical, there are a lot of neat features you can get by modding & you just need to choose the right ROM. Here are six of the best. 
  </p>

  <p>
  If you're new to the world of Android rooting, though, it's worth looking at our 

  <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/android-modding-101-what-you-need-to-know-1217171">previous coverage</a> 

  of modding, where we explain some of the more bizarre acronyms and explain why anyone would want to spend an evening in with a microUSB cable and a command line. 
  </p>

  <p> 
  Most importantly, bear in mind that all the software here is hobbyist-made and constantly changing &ndash; and as a result, it can be buggy from time to time, and support for devices can change in the blink of an eye.

  <div class="ui segment">
  <a class="ui top left attached label">CyanogenMod
  </a>
  <img class="ui small left floated circular image" src="../assets/images/roms/rom.png">

  Probably the most famous of all the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/android" title="Android">Android</a> ROMs, CyanogenMod is certainly the most stable and well-updated, at the very least. It's also trying to turn itself into more of a regular business (and a rival to stock Android). Most recently, that's seen it build a one-touch installer that simplified somewhat the installation process. (However, the installer only lasted a week before being removed from the Play store by Google.)<p>Cyanogen plays it pretty close to stock Android in terms of look and feel &ndash; the launcher and settings menus are almost identical, on first glance. However, handy things like a file manager and a better camera app are also included out of the box. </p><p>CM's strength, though is in the depth of settings. If you want to customize your phone to be exactly how you want it, CyanogenMod's the perfect ROM, offering deep-level hardware customization that can speed your phone up, and simple tweaks like fixing stock Android's lack of an inbuilt battery percentage. </p>

  <a class="ui top right attached label">Paranoid Android
  </a>
  
  <img class="ui small right floated circular image" src="../assets/images/roms/rom.jpg">
<p>
  Paranoid Android offers most of the same minor tweaks to performance as seen in CyanogenMod, but with one big bonus: a hybrid mode. This allows you to scale certain on-screen elements to make them bigger or smaller &ndash; say, for example, if you didn't want the drop-down notification tab to take up the whole screen. It's mostly aimed at bigger smartphones with more pixel-dense screens, to allow you to take full advantage of the size. </p><p>Paranoid Android also lets you change the color scheme in the settings menu, which is obviously handy if you like matching your phone to your outfit. There's also a multi-window feature in beta, which solidifies Paranoid Android's place as the best custom ROM for phablets, at the very least. </p><p>Performance-wise, it's a little buggy, with occasional crashes. However, it's blazing fast, going just as fast (or faster) on a Galaxy Note 2 than the stock Samsung firmware. </p>
