  “What is a Nexus device?” seems like a very strange question to ask on a site dedicated to all things Android. But that’s not entirely so, because there are plenty of mobile consumers that don’t happen to own a smart device yet, whether we’re talking smartphones or a tablets.

  Despite being an integral part of Android, the Nexus brand may not be as well known to new smart device buyers as the iPhone and/or the iPad, or Apple’s mobile devices. Similarly, it may be not clear to some people that the Nexus is an Android device, which brings us to the point of this particular article.

  In case you haven’t guessed it by now, a Nexus is a family of smart devices that are sold by Google. Whether a smartphone or a tablet, the Nexus runs Android – in most cases the latest Android version out there – and represents Google’s own vision of what an Android device should look and feel like.

  Unlike the heavily marketed iPhone and iPad that are selling by the boatload, Nexus devices are yet to become equally popular when it comes to sales, but Google keeps making them, and for good reason. Without Nexus devices around, we’d hardly have any smartphone or tablet out there running the latest Android software, and Google can’t have that.

  If you will, we’ll use the tree-in-the-forest existential question. If a tree falls in the forest but there’s nobody there, does it make any sounds? Similarly, if Google launches an Android OS version, but there’s no device running it to be launched immediately after, will Android make the same noise in the mobile ecosystem?

At this point in the smartphone industry, most knowledgeable users have a pretty good idea about the different smartphone companies.  The smartphone buying decision usually gets influenced by the device’s hardware and gimmicky features that look cool in the store when you first play with them. The Nexus devices are free from manufacturer or carrier modifications, so you get the stock Android OS experience. In the past these modifications were justifiable because Android was still in its early stages, but Android has improved.

Another advantage of using Google Nexus devices is the prompt software updates you receive from Google. Unlike the past days, smartphone and tablet software is constantly updated every year with new features and performance improvements.  The non-Nexus devices, like Samsung Galaxy or HTC One, receive updates depending on the manufacturer and the carrier.  It is a very long update process for non-Nexus devices mainly because the manufacturer first takes time to apply all their modifications and then the carrier takes time to test the device.

Most of the smartphones come locked when purchased from your carrier and there is usually a fee involved if you want to unlock the phone.  The Nexus devices don’t face this problem as they are sold factory unlocked and you can use them on any network of your choice.  You don’t have to jump through hoops to get your carrier to unlock a phone once your contract is up, you can also use another carrier’s SIM card when travelling overseas, and it is also very easy to sell smartphone when it is not locked to one carrier.
