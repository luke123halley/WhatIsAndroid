        <h2> 
The Popularity of Android Over Time
</h2>

<p>
There's a very good chance the Android you have in front of you isn't just powered by the open Android — it needs some extra bits included to make a very different version of Android. Don't feel confused just yet.

Whether you have a Nexus phone or a Samsung phone or a Motorola phone or any other brand of phone running Android, they all use a version of Android that has those extra bits. These extras aren't part of the open Android, and you can't freely distribute any of them (even it happens all the time, and generally nobody seems to be too bothered about it).

Your Galaxy S6 runs Android. So does your HTC M9. Or your Sony Xperia. Even your Nexus 5. But they are all very different from each other, and are also different from the open version of Android — which they are ultimately based on.

But they are still Android. We want the extras, whether they be the Google applications and Google Play. This is the Android we all use and love.
</p>

<h2> 
The Android You're Holding
</h2>  

<p>
If you're the type of person reading about Android on the Internet regularly, you know the phone you're holding is a Samsung Galaxy S5. Or an LG G3. Or whatever. But for many folks (most people, I'd wager) they are holding an Android.

The same way that a Lumia 635 is a Windows Phone, or a BlackBerry Passport is a BlackBerry, or even an iPhone 4S is an iPhone, your Sony Xperia Z3V is an Android.

Lumping everything together isn't such a bad idea. All (modern) Androids can run the same apps, use the same services from Google, and have our unrivaled love and affection. OK, maybe not that, but generally all Androids running Android as built from Android are as similar as they are different.
