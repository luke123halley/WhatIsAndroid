  Android vs iOS
</h2>

<p>
  Google's <strong>Android</strong> and Apple's <strong>iOS</strong> are operating systems used primarily in 

  <a href="/difference/Category:Mobile_Devices" title="Category:Mobile Devices">mobile technology</a>, such as smartphones and tablets. Android, which is 

  <a href="http://data.diffen.com/Linux" title="Special:Information/Linux">Linux</a>

  based and partly open source, is more 
  <a href="/difference/Mac_vs_PC" title="Mac vs PC">PC</a>

  like than iOS, in that its interface and basic features are generally more customizable from top to bottom. However, iOS' uniform design elements are sometimes seen as being more user
  friendly.
  </p>
  <p>
  You should choose your smartphone and tablet systems carefully, as switching from iOS to Android or vice versa will require you to buy apps again in the Google Play or Apple App Store. Android is now the worldâ€™s most commonly used smartphone platform and is used by many different phone manufacturers. iOS is only used on Apple devices, such as the <a href="/difference/iPhone_5c_vs_iPhone_5s" title="iPhone 5c vs iPhone 5s">iPhone</a>.

  Permissions requested by Pandora's Android app. An Android user cannot use Pandora's app without accepting all of these permission requests.

  </p><p>
  When it comes to protecting users' private information, iOS wins. When installing apps on Android, the user is presented with all the permissions that the app is requesting. This is an all-or-nothing proposition. The user can choose to accept the app's request for permissions or not install the app at all. App developers take advantage of this "feature" and request a lot of user information. For example, 
  <a href="/difference/Pandora_vs_Spotify" title="Pandora vs Spotify">Pandora's</a> 

  mobile app on Android requests permissions for your Google identity, contacts, calendar, photos, media, files and even call information. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Pandora's app on iOS gets no such permissions. After it is installed and opened by the user, an iOS app may request additional permissions like location and access to Contacts. But the user can reject these permission requests. Even after approving the permission requests, iOS users can quickly glance at which apps have access to their <i>Contacts</i> and location data, and turn off access for apps with which they no longer want to share this data.
  </p>

  In November 2014, 
  <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/11/26/twitter-is-tracking-users-installed-apps-for-ad-targeting/" class="external text" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
  Twitter announced</a> that it is now tracking the list of apps its users have installed on their phones. Both iOS and Android are vulnerable &mdash; an app installed on either platform can get a list of other apps installed on the same device.
