Wearables are the next big frontier for smart technology. And on March 18, 2014, Google announced its part in it — Android Wear. As the name implies, Android Wear is an Android-based initiative, using Google's mobile operating system and a dedicated software development kit to kick-start the wearables space.

On August 31, 2015, it was announced that Android Wear would also be compatible with iOS devices. iOS users can receive notifications & Google Now cards, as well as use voice commands, using the LG Watch Urbane — with other devices said to follow down the road.

Android on your wrist is still Android. That means it's still Linux, and people will want to do more than the simple user interface provides. We get it. We paid for these devices, and some of us want to do whatever we want with them. Abuse them. Misuse them. Hack them within an inch of their lives. Then put them all back together like we never touched them. Having your sudo sandwich on every device feels good.

Right now (yes, this very instant!), things are just warming up on the Android Wear hacking front. The devices are new, things are a little different, and everyone who has one is tinkering with it to find out just what can be done. But Android Wear is still Android, and mods and ROMs and hacks will (and are already starting to) happen — especially because the bootloaders are easily unlocked. Thanks, Google.

  This year's Google IO developer conference wasn't just about the upcoming Android L release and the design changes coming with that version. One of the keynote's most important announcements was packed into a two-minute segment at the start of the event. Android One, as Android chief Sundar Pichai explained, was designed to level the playing field for smartphones in developing markets, making it easier for smaller phone makers in these countries to ship relatively high-quality stuff at relatively low price points.

  Three months later we're seeing the first fruits from this endeavor, as Android One arrives in India. We've got our hands on the Micromax Canvas A1, one of the first Android One phones to go on sale. And what we've found is a surprisingly speedy vanilla Android handset with a few tweaks for the Indian market.
  </p>

  <p>
  From a Western perspective, it's easy to draw parallels between Android One and the Nexus or Google Play edition programs (or even the rumored Android Silver endeavor). In reality, the purpose and execution of Android One is very different. Hardware components are selected by Google, which also takes the lead on software for these devices. From there, local OEMs can add relevant apps and tweak the external hardware to add their own flavor. (The current Android One lineup includes similar-looking devices from Spice and Karbonn, for instance.)

  Essentially, the goal is for Android One to facilitate the spread of Google-controlled Android among the next billion (or two billion, or more) smartphone buyers by offering a compelling entry-level product, aided by local OEMs. In turn, the fact that manufacturers won't need to worry about software or sourcing hardware components means they can turn around products more quickly.

  Much in the same way that smartphones have come to enhance the way we communicate, the world of connected home tech is all about enhancing the way your living space communicates. There are a couple of really great examples of this technology (and heaps of truly terrible examples to match) but one of the best right now is the Nest Thermostat. Nest Labs was created to build products that change how we use regular household tech, with an immediate focus on efficiency, safety, and ease of use. The biggest reason to consider one for yourself, aside from how nice it looks on the wall, is all of the tech baked into this tiny casing that dramatically changes how you use your thermostat.
  </p>

  <p>
  On the surface, Nest Thermostat is a connected thermostat with an Android app that lets you remotely control the temperature. Connected thermostats are nothing new, but Nest worked especially hard to make the user experience simple (and even enjoyable) for everyone. The dial-style thermostat is familiar, even though the color screen and animated UI are completely new experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
  Through this new interface you have several options for keeping your house warm or cool, including a temperature range for both if you live in a place where the Spring and Fall have regular 50-degree jumps in temperature over a 12-hour period and you need both heating and air conditioning (looking at you, Maryland). The regular temperature settings include your basic dial and big numbers to set a desired temperature when you're home, but also a minimum or maximum temperature for when you're away. To make things easy, Nest includes a little green leaf that pops up on the display when you're entering a temperature range that will most likely save you money.
