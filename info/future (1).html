        Apple's Maps app may not have set the world alight when it launched, but it's here now (alongside Nokia's offering), and that means Google needs to up its game to stay ahead. Recent Google Maps refreshes have brought with them a greater level of customisation based on your personal searches, and this will only increase in the future.

        With Google Now tracking your every move, you might already be seeing directions to your favourite pub appear on-screen every Friday lunchtime or to the 5-a-side pitch every Monday evening, all handled automatically.

        Google has already made its intentions clear with the Hangouts and the central role in plays in the company's new Project Fi platform. With Facebook, WhatsApp, FaceTime, Snapchat, Skype et al to battle against, there's no doubt we'll see Google push further into the universal messaging game, covering SMS, email, instant messaging and video calling with tools that are baked into Android and can be accessed from the web too.

        In fact it's a surprise that Google still hasn't unified all of its messaging components.

        2015 has been the year when mobile payments have really started to come into focus (thanks Apple Pay) but there's a lot more to come in terms of phones replacing cash and verifying our identities (everything from getting through the door at work to logging into Facebook).

        The Android phone of 2020 could automatically log you into Gmail when you sit down at your laptop, for example, or pay for your flight when you step on a plane. Android devices can already unlock Chrome OS instead of a password, so to an extent this technology is already here.

        The only certainty about Android's future is that it has a fight on its hands to stay competitive. Apple's iOS 9 has given Google plenty to think about - mostly by borrowing features from Android, like the new "proactive" elements of Siri.

        Android's continuing integration with Chrome and the desktop/laptop will make for an interesting story too - they're both run by the same man, Sundar Pichai, remember - and perhaps Google's biggest challenge will be to convince us that we can trust it with more and more information about where we are.

        Hardware innovations are going to play a big part in Android's roadmap. Besides the obvious smaller, thinner, faster improvements for our phones, bendable screens should be in place in the near future - the likes of Samsung have the tech already in production, and Android will change to adapt itself through scrolling rivers of news, status updates and other notifications.

        Ever-changing, ever-optimising displays will be the order of the day, and the batteries and mobile processors of 2020 should be able to keep up.

        The rapidly changing smartphone market is playing right into the hands of people like Sammy Ohev-Zion, CEO of Blu Products.

        The six-year-old smartphone brand, which is based in Miami and stands for “Bold Like Us,” next month will sell a $129 model that basically has the same components as Motorola’s best-selling phone, the Moto G. Yet that Blu phone, called “Life XL,” retails for $50 less than the Moto G.The phone runs a near-stock Android 5.1 Lollipop operating system, this phone could be upgradable to Android 6.0 Marshmallow.
